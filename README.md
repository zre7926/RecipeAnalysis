## Introduction
Cooking time is one of the most important factors shaping how people choose recipes online. Whether you're a busy student, a working parent, or someone just trying to get dinner on the table, the time a recipe takes can be a dealbreaker. Many users will filter out recipes that take too long before even considering the ingredients or the rating. At the same time, there’s a trade-off: longer recipes may result in more flavorful or satisfying meals, but they can also intimidate or deter users, especially if the payoff isn’t clearly worth the time investment.

In this project, we will be using two datasets - one containing recipes and one containing reviews to those recipes. Both datasets come from food.com. 

The first dataset (`recipe`) has 83782 rows (thus there are that many recipes) and 12 columns, which are

a dataset containing over 10,000 recipes sourced from a popular cooking platform, enriched with user interactions like star ratings and reviews. Our central question is: Do people rate recipes that take longer to prepare lower, and can we predict how long a recipe takes based on its features? This matters because it touches both user psychology and platform design. If longer prep times are linked with lower ratings, then recipe creators might want to simplify their instructions, or at least set user expectations more clearly. Conversely, if well-rated recipes tend to have certain features—like fewer steps, fewer ingredients, or shorter descriptions—those insights could help generate smarter, more efficient content for culinary platforms.
